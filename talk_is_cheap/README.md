# React Hooks

     A normal javascript function , with some superpowers that is just some logic which is written in the hook function but for simplicity we say it has some superpowers😁

### Most importent hooks

- useState()
- useEffect()

## useState()

Now we will learn useState().

1. import useState from react

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
```

2. Declear state

```javascript
  const [restrorentList,serRestrorentList] = useState(restaurantList);

  syntex is

  const[variable,setVariable] = useState(initialValueOfVariable);
```

<h2 style="color:lightBlue">whenever a state veriable updates react re-renders the component</h2>
