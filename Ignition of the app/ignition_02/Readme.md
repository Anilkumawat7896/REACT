# ignition part 2

here we have replaced the cdn liks with the original import or the React and React-DOM

# parcel

- dev builds
- Local server
- HMR (Hot module replacement)
- file watching algorithum written in c++
- parcel is cacheing things for us (result is :-- faster builds) it is caching things in the ``.parcel-cache folder/directory` which was introduces at the time of parcel installation
- Image optimization
- minification of files (in the production builds)
- bundling
- compression
- consistent hashing
- code spliting for us
- diffential bundeling ( to support older browser )
- Dignostic
- Error handling
- https
- tree shaking (remove unused code for us)
- different dev and production bundle


      if by mistake the `.parcel-cache forlder/directory`is deleted than at the time of build it will be reganrated so don't worry to much Golu ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

      parcel is in one of the most resones for the production ready apps to run faster
